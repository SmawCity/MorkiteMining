# Overview

This was a game I wanted to try making just to test the waters of game development. I have never developed a game before, so this is mostly from a template that I found on the Python Arcade Library (You can find their website below). I tried to make it my own by including audio, ranging from background music to voice lines, in addition to a few smaller functionalities. 

This game has you control a robot who collects a mineral known as morkite until there is no more to collect. You use the arrow keys to move around the map, collecting the mineral until the map is empty. Upon that time, you have completed your mission and a drop pod arroves tp pick you up, signalling the end of the game.

# Development Environment

I developed this game in the Visual Studio Code IDE in Python. In order to do that, I utilized tools from the Python Arcade library.

# Future Work

* Add collision to the border of the maps
* Change the player character to use a more relevant image
* Add a second controllable character to mine the mineral while the other collects it
